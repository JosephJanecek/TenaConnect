TenaConnect Overview

This was my three month long project for my Software as a Service class.  This project was done be me and two other students.  We came up with the idea and built the entire application from the ground up using the M.E.A.N. stack in an agile environment.  My contrubution was as a full stack developer.  My code is everything relating to: Landlord/ACManager, fileSystem, PaymentManager, and TenantDirectory with some controbution to core.  I also worked on Tenant/fileSystem, PaymentManager and parts of core.  For these parts of the app I coded both the frontend and backend.  We all, as a team worked on defining the database environment and designing the schema for the json objects.

At the end of each sprint, which where two weeks long, we had to present our progress to the class.  Durring the presentation the class would document feedback for us.  At the begining of each sprint we had to go through this user feedback and decide what was useful and productive for us to incorporate in the next iteration of the app.
